        <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
        <p>I started this website with the intention to tell my story and share it with the World in order for me to relate with the youngsters out there.<br>This is to give comfort and shelter to our own stories.I want to show you how much struggle, happiness, and faults we have in common.<br> I guess the bottomline is we're separated, but not alone...only if we choose to see it. I may not be that superstar or that model you look up to,<br> but I am that teenager who once found themselve in your shoes. Let's tell that story!</p>

        <h1>STORY</h1>
        <h3>---Err'day life---</h3>
        <p>The oily, spit filled , uneven roads of Langa, decorated with cigarette buds and moles. Houses and shacks neighbouring each other, sponsored by crime.<br> The Huge blinding wave of smoke coming from the fires set alight by the aunts trying to sell sheep heads-that we never even bother to greet when passing<br> by-and an object of demise, virtually stuck on the hand of the ghetto youth, that feel's motivated to support the somali spazas, buying lighters day in day out.<br> Yes, these are the streets where I reside, and I "was" that ghetto teen. I also used to believe that change was for the fancy small population, that has nothing<br> else to do with there lives. But not so deep inside, I longed for that change that I hate speeched so much, and peer stigma wouldn't let me get a single taste of it.<br> So there I was...propagandered to know I had no choice but to pretend I'm delighted with the person I am. I had the perfect support to help me go down<br> life's drain, sometimes I could hear there cheers. People I thought were my friends, and later on I realised they were just fans... </p>
        <p>...I also went to one of the community's underdeveloped primary schools, where they would teach kids how to construct a Curriculum Vitae,<br> but never bother teaching them how to be the Big guy that people write those CV's to. Believe me I also trailed the everyday morning trips<br> where we pretend to use the drug when in actual fact we're being used by the drug...How easy it was to do, surely it would be just as easy to stop, right?<br> My thoughts had deceived me, and the time period between starting and stopping became shorter and shorter till it was no more.<br> I slowly became secluded from my original world, and the people I knew and gave my respect started changing, soon I found myself in the center of a totally different circle...</p>
        <h3>---Personal Changes---</h3>
        <p>...Now, a lot had changed.Looking at my mother in the eyes, she's looking at me like a new person.<br> Someone in me told me slow down...the pain won't go away with the changes. All I innocently wanted was to get away from all my problems,<br> instead I built them a mansion inside and they sure had a lot of reletives. The escape plan was emphetamins and a well scaled ecstacy for the weekend,<br> and so my problems escalated...Realising this was the problem did not make things any better, and I felt guilty at the fact that I was starting to enjoy it.<br> It felt so good when I'm with friends, but felt so bad when I'm at home. I started felling uncumfortable in my own home, talking to my mother seemed to get harder...<br>That's when I realised Inga was left in the past, and Stilo(friends nickname) took over. I tried convincing myself that there's nothing wrong with the person I've become,<br> but I just couldn't. The more I tried, the more I missed myself, my clean self...</p>
        <p>...I struggled away a lot of time, trying to change myself to fit my situation, instead of changing my situation to fit me. I changed the way I used to think, and a lot<br> changed with it, what's so different about this time.If I used this road to where i am now, why not take the same way back. Changing how my mind thinks is the only way to get back, <br>coz it's the only way I got in... </p>
        <h3>---I Change my Mind---</h3>
        <p>...I Changed My Mind. Everything started to seem easier, but not quit how I preffered them to be. So I started with my own home.<br> Changing my attitude towards my family, and it actually made me feel better about being my mother's child. I changed from talking, to listening.<br>I listened to the the people who I claimed to care about, and tried my best to adjust to what they preffered to smile at. I noticed a change in my inner circle,<br> and even gained greetings from people whom I never even knew they know my name.  </p>
