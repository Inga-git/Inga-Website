        <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
        <p>I started this website with the intention to tell my story and share it with the World in order for me to relate with the youngsters out there.<br>This is to give comfort and shelter to our own stories.I want to show you how much struggle, happiness, and faults we have in common.<br> I guess the bottomline is we're separated, but not alone...only if we choose to see it. I may not be that superstar or that model you look up to,<br> but I am that teenager who once found themselve in your shoes. Let's tell that story!</p>

        <h1>STORY</h1>
        <h3>---Err'day life---</h3>
        <p>The oily, spit filled , uneven roads of Langa, decorated with cigarette buds and moles.<br> Houses and shacks neighbouring each other, sponsored by crime.The Huge blinding <br>wave of smoke coming from the fires set alight by the aunts trying to sell sheep heads<br>that we never even bother to greet when passing by-and an object of demise, virtually<br> stuck on the hand of the ghetto youth, that feel's motivated to support the somali spazas,<br> buying lighters day in day out. Yes, these are the streets where I reside, and I "was" that <br>ghetto teen. I also used to believe that change was for the fancy small population, that has<br> nothing else to do with there lives. But not so deep inside, I longed for that change that I <br>hate speeched so much, and peer stigma wouldn't let me get a single taste of it. So there<br> I was...propagandered to know I had no choice but to pretend I'm delighted with the person<br> I am. I had the perfect support to help me go down life's drain, sometimes I could hear there <br>cheers.People I thought were my friends, and later on I realised they were just fans... </p>
        <h3>---Personal Changes---</h3>
        <p>...Now, a lot had changed.Looking at my mother in the eyes, she's looking at me like a <br> new person. Someone in me told me slow down...the pain won't go away with the <br>changes. All I innocently wanted was to get away from all my problems, instead I built<br> them a mansion inside and they sure had a lot of reletives. The escape plan was <br>emphetamins and a well scaled ecstacy for the weekend, and so my problems escalated...<br>Realising this was the problem did not make things any better, and I felt guilty at the fact<br> that I was starting to enjoy it. It felt so good when I'm with friends, but felt so bad when I'm at home.<br> I started felling uncumfortable in my own home, talking to my mother seemed to get harder...<br>That's when I realised Inga was left in the past, and Stilo(friends nickname) took over. I tried <br>convincing myself that there's nothing wrong with the person I've become,<br> but I just couldn't. The more I tried, the more I missed myself, my clean self...</p>
        <h3>---I Change my Mind---</h3>
        <p>...I Changed My Mind. Everything started to seem easier, but not quit how I preffered them to be.<br> So I started with my own home.Changing my attitude towards my family, and it actually made me <br>feel better about being my mother's child. I changed from talking, to listening.I listened to the the <br>people who I claimed to care about, and tried my best to adjust to what they preffered to smile at.<br> I noticed a change in my inner circle,and even gained greetings from people whom I never even <br>knew they know my name. </p>
